## Experiment freely with Web3 

SealVault is the first key manager with automated transaction approval. This
keeps you safe and gets out of the way simultaneously.

## Features

### Automated transaction approval ü•≥

You decide which dapp to add, after that transactions are approved
automatically.
[Learn more.](https://sealvault.org/one-dapp-per-key/)

### One-Dapp-Per-Key :fire:

When you add a dapp to your account, a new key is generated just for this dapp.
Wallet addresses are never connected to dapps.
This protects you from phishing and mitigates compromised dapps.

### Move assets between wallets and dapps üí∞

First class token transfer support for dapp addresses. 
You can also transfer a pre-configured amount automatically when you add a new dapp.

### Isolated identities üï∂Ô∏è

Organize your dapps into profiles for isolated identities.

## Status

The project is currently in public beta with an iOS app and Polygon PoS support.

Install the iOS beta [here.](https://testflight.apple.com/join/EHQYn6Oz)

Please reach out [on Telegram](https://t.me/agostbiro) for support and feedback.

Support for more platforms and blockchains is coming. You can find out more in the [intro blog post.](https://sealvault.org/blog/web3-vision/)

## [Developer Docs](https://sealvault.org/dev-docs/)

Documentation for SealVault developers containing design documents on the
[security](https://sealvault.org/dev-docs/design/security-model/) and [privacy](https://sealvault.org/dev-docs/design/privacy-model/) models of the application and more.

## Components

### [Core](./core)

Cross-platform key and transaction management for Web3 written in Rust. 
Uses SQLite for storage and depends on platform-specific keychain to store 
key encryption keys.
Exposed to host languages via [uniffi-rs](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs).

### [iOS](./ios)

iOS Web3 password manager app with a built-in web browser. Written in Swift with 
the SwiftUI framework.

### [Tools](./tools)

Contains development server for integration testing in-page providers and other 
development tools written in Rust such as a fuzzer.

### [Website](./website)

Provides landing page and features for end users, developer documentation for
SealVault developers and the SealVault blog. Powered by [Material for
MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Development

On first time setup, install the [requirements](#development-requirements)
listed below and then run `./ci.py` from the repo root to check if everything
was installed correctly. (:warning: The CI script will reset all iOS simulators
on your machine.)

The CI script will also create the generated files for you that are a
prerequisites for an Xcode build. Alternatively you can generate these files by
running `fastlane pre_build` in the `ios` directory.

### Development Requirements

- MacOS Monterey and an Apple Silicon Mac for iOS development. You may be able 
  to work on an Intel Mac, but we won't be able to help you with Rust-related 
  build issues as the maintainers are on Apple Silicon.
- XCode 14 IDE and CLI tools get the Xcode IDE from the app store and then run
  `xcode-select --install` to install CLI tools.
- The [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) macOS package manager, then run `brew bundle`
  from the repo root to install the dependencies specified in the
  [`Brewfile`.](./Brewfile)
- Run `rustup-init` which was installed from the [`Brewfile`](./Brewfile) 
  toolchain and follow the instructions to set up your Rust toolchain.
- The [Diesel](https://diesel.rs/) ORM CLI that we use to manage Sqlite (it's
  very important to use the bundled Sqlite version as outdated Sqlite make cause
  migrations to fail):
  - `cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features sqlite-bundled` 
- The [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.16/index.html) compiler 
  version manager and `solc 0.8.16` that are needed to compile test contracts 
  for unit tests:
  - `cargo install svm-rs` then `svm install 0.8.16`
- The [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation) 
  Ethereum development tools of which Anvil is needed for unit tests.

### Tests

Run all tests from the repo root with: `./ci.py`. (:warning: The CI script will
reset all iOS simulators on your machine.)

### Useful commands

- Update Rust toolchain to latest nightly: `rustup update`.
  - We need nightly for iOS simulator on MacOS Apple Silicon.
  - If the CI fails for you locally, make sure you're on the latest nightly.
- Clean Rust build from repo root: `cargo clean`.
- Rebuild Rust XCFramework for iOS and regenerate Swift bindings from `ios`
  directory: `fastlane pre_build`
- Clean Xcode build from `ios` directory: `fastlane clean`.
